## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of NetHTTP Guard seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until I have fixed it.
2. **Report the vulnerability through GitHub's security advisory feature**:
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Guard-Core/nethttp-guard/security/advisories) of the NetHTTP Guard repository
   - Click on "New draft security advisory"
   - Fill in the details of the vulnerability
   - Submit the advisory

   Alternatively, you can report vulnerabilities through [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/Guard-Core/nethttp-guard/security/advisories/new).

3. Include the following information in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Affected versions
   - Any potential mitigations or workarounds

I will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and send a detailed response within 7 days, including the next steps in handling the vulnerability.

## Security Considerations

NetHTTP Guard is a security library: report anything that weakens detection, bypasses rate limiting, leaks secrets into logs, or trusts unvalidated input.
